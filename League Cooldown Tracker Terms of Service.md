## 8. Binding Arbitration

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.  IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT**

### A. Generally: 
In the interest of resolving disputes in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you agree that every dispute arising in connection with the Agreement will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, extra-contractual liability, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of the Agreement. The arbitrator also has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

**YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THE AGREEMENT, YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. THE SAME GOES FOR US.**


### B. Exceptions: 
Despite the provisions of Section 8.A, you and us both agree that nothing in the Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court within its jurisdictional limits; (b) file a complaint with the applicable federal, provincial, territorial, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file a suit in a court of law solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of our Service.

### C. Arbitrator: 
All disputes arising out of or in connection with this agreement, or in respect of any legal relationship associated with or derived from this agreement, will be finally resolved by arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the ADR Institute of Canada, Inc. (the “ADR Rules”), except as otherwise set out in this Agreement. The language of the arbitration will be English.

### D. Notice and Process:
If you intent to seek arbitration, you must first send us a notice of the dispute through our email which is displayed on our facebook page (fb.me/kryoapps) in the about section. 

Attention: Legal Department. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). You and us both agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you or us do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or us may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, we will pay you the amount awarded by the arbitrator, whichever is greater. The arbitration proceedings, including any exchanged materials, shall be confidential and you and us agree to use reasonable efforts to streamline the proceedings, including discovery, consistent with the objectives of efficient dispute resolution.


### E. Fees:
Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Montreal, Quebec. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, if allowed by the ADR Rules, you agree to pay our fees too.

Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.


### F. No Class Actions:
**YOU AND US AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.**

Unless both you and us agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.


### G. Enforceability:
If any provision of this Section 8 is unlawful, void, or unenforceable for any reason, then that provision will be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Section 8.F is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 8 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 8 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the jurisdiction and venue described in Section 10.A will govern any action arising out of or related to the Agreement.
